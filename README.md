Algorithms
1. Logistic Regression
2. SVM
3. KNN



Datasets

2. Chess https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chess+%28King-Rook+vs.+King-Knight%29

5. Lung cancer https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Lung+Cancer


Plan

Week 8 
(Mon/Tues/Wed) - attempt to recreate results for "Letter" 
    - data = https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition
(Thur/Fri) - do again for different data set(s) 
    - 7-10k samples
    
    
 
 Dataset 1:
 
 Some issues:
  - error metrics were not happening w/in the call
  - unregularized, regularized Logistic regression (separate)
  - SVM: different kernals (separate)
  - KNN: K = |trainset| ????
